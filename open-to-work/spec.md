in this folder, I want to create a simple "open to work" motion animation either using remotion react/plain js (canvas, svg)

the animation sequence is

1. every letter will be constructed in a lego-dropping constructing mechanism
2. for example, the "O" will be constructed by several sub-pieces that will be dropped down until it crafts an O.

I don't know what technology that is capable of doing this.
